Tl;dr: Arch, i3, rofi, st, zsh, tmux, vim

Per environment variables set in [.config/.zprofile](https://github.com/nyuutsu/dotfiles/blob/main/nyuu/.config/.zprofile) many of these files are in nondefault directories. If something isn't working, set the environment variable or put the file in the default location rather than my location. Probably do not use my .zprofile as-is to do this. It remaps a *lot* of stuff. It would be pretty easy to overlook a change that trips you up in six months.
